# End-to-End_Data_Analysis_Workflow

The following project illustrates an Gen AI induced End-to-End data analysis pipeline starting from data preprocessing to presenting PPT summaries to stake holders. It consists of following aspects :

**1. Delinquency prediction dataset :** A raw dataset collected from a financial organisation providing different banking services to it's clients. It consists of various inconsistencies which were further dealt with.

**2. EDA_of_data :** The complete codebase of the whole data preprocessing flow. Starting from checking nan value to creating a seperate dataset consisting of only key variables for further handling.

**3. EDA_&_risk_profile :** This documentation was made with the help of Gen AI. It consists of all the immediate insights drawn from the raw dataset during initial data handling.

**4. Delinquency prediction dataset cleaned :** The filtered dataset which was extracted from the initial processing.

**5. Predictive_model_layout :** This part consists of the overall blueprint of the model and its relevance to the usecase. It also highlights the evaluation metrics to be used.

**6. Business_summary_report :** This pdf documents the revised insights drawn from data along with visual proofs. Thereafter, An efficeient SMART recommendation with respect to those insights.

**7. Stakeholders_presentation :** The final PPT presentation for the clients. It illustrates the complete AI imputed proposed workflow. It also lists the guardrails to be placed at ever stage of the flow along with measurable expected business outcomes

This whole project was done during my **Gen AI powered Data Analyst** job simulation under **TATA IQ** whose completion certificate is given below.
